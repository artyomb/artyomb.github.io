Recently I found new site [dry-rb.org](https://dry-rb.org/). 
It is the society of Ruby lovers that developing a bunch of libraries with DRY concept.  


I was looking for JSON schema libraries and found the following ones to be very interesting: 

- [dry-validation](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-validation/)

- [dry-schema](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-schema)

I'm very happy that Ruby still has the adepts!
