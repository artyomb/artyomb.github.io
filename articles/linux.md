### What have I found to be a must-have for Linux workstation
The _strong_ setup:

- apt install mc htop screen
- SSH Server
- OpenVPV client (Personal VPN server)
- Tor (Hidden service: 22, Socks5 9050)
- Duplicity (Encrypted backups)
- Syncthing (Dedicated backup server)
- Mega Sync (Live sync backup)

Any additional suggestions?
